Built a complete relational database and used **advanced SQL only** to answer real business questions:

- Who are my best (and worst) customers?  
- Which cuisine wins in which city?  
- Why are we getting 0 ratings in some locations?  
- What quick changes bring more happy customers & revenue?

## 💡 Top Business Insights
- Students review the most → obsessed with **Mexican** & **Pizzeria**  
- **Cuernavaca** = happiest city (Medium price + Wine-Beer = winning formula)

- Franchises crush independent restaurants in ratings  
- **Ciudad Victoria** has a food quality crisis (tons of 0s)
